@W: MT529 :"/home/nmh6120/ce387/CE392/rtl/grayscale.vhd":45:8:45:9|Found inferred clock lanedetect_top|i_CLK which controls 103 sequential elements including grayscale_inst.q_grayscale_pixel[15:8]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
